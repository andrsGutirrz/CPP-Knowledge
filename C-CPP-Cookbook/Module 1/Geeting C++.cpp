/*
In order to use C++, you simple need a compiler, there are many C++ compilers, I recommend gcc or Cywing compilers. These compilers
run on the console o terminal (Linux).
Other way to use C++ consist in install and IDE that runs C++, The most common is Visual Studio, and it has its own compiler, so you dont need
extra steps to use C++, in the other hand, we have NetBeans, but in this case, yo need to install a compiler in order to use C++.
There are many videos of how to run C++ on Netbeans.

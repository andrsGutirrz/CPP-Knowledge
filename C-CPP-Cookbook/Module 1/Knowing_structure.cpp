// #include is used for include extra code (libraries), we will see it later, in clases
#include <iostream>// library contains input/output functions (cin,cout)
using namespace std; //allow us to use cout and cin with out "std::"

// C++ uses ; at the end of a statement
int main(){// main function, everything inside that block, will be executed

    // print something in the console
    cout<<"Hola Mundo"<<endl;
    // operator<< 
    //endl: jumps to new line
    return 0;// main function returns and integer
